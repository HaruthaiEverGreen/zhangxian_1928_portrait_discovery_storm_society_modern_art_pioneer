## 🔬 Scientific Examination

### 1. UV Fluorescence Analysis  
Conducted at the **Thailand Institute of Nuclear Technology (TINT)**.  
- **Method**: UV purple light (fluorescence)  
- **Result**: No abnormal fluorescence detected.  
- **Interpretation**: Indicates absence of modern pigments, varnishes, or restoration; supports the hypothesis of 19th–early 20th century origin.

### 2. Elemental Pigment Analysis  
Conducted at the **Department of Nuclear Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University** (Bangkok).  
- **Result**: High levels of **arsenic (As)** detected in the green pigments.  
- **Implication**: Consistent with historical use of arsenic-based pigments such as **Emerald Green**, which were phased out in the mid-20th century due to toxicity.

## 🖋️ Historical Significance  
Zhang Xian was a key figure in early Chinese modernism, appearing in official records alongside **Pang Xunqin**, **Liu Haisu**, and **Fu Lei**. This portrait—signed and dated in the Gregorian calendar—was likely created during his time in France before the Storm Society was founded.

This may be the **only confirmed realistic portrait** from Zhang’s hand, differing from his later Fauvist landscapes found in Shanghai collections.
