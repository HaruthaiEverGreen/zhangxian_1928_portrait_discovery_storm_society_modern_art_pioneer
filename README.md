Zhang Xian (1928) Portrait Discovery: A Milestone in Modern Chinese Art

üñºÔ∏è Overview

This dataset presents the rediscovery of a lost portrait believed to be painted by Zhang Xian (Âº†Âº¶) in 1928 during his time in France. It includes high-resolution documentation, scientific pigment analysis, historical validation, and family provenance.

The portrait is considered one of the most important human-figure oil paintings attributed to Zhang Xian and is potentially the only realistic portrait among his known works. It is stylistically consistent with the academic training Zhang received in France and is historically connected to the formative years of the Chinese Storm Society.
